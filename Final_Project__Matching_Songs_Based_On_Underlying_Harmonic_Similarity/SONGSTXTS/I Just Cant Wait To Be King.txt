[Simba] I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

[Zazu]  Well, I've never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair.

[Simba] I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before!
            C                                               G
        I'm brushing up I'm looking down. I'm working on my roar!
             Am                 G      D
[Zazu]  Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing.

               G
No one saying 'see here.'[Now see here!]
C       G    Am    C   D
Free to run around all day,[Well, that's definitley out.]
C                 D  D7  G

[Zazu]  I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart.
        C                                   G
[Simba] Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start.

[Zazu]  If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out!
                C                         G
Out of service, out of Africa. I wouldn't hang about.
      Am                             D
This child is getting wildly out of wing!
              C          D          G
[Simba] Oh I just can't wait to be king!
