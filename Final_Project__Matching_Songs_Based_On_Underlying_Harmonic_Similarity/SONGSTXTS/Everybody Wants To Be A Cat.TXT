Intro: Em / Em/D# / Em/D / Em/C# / Cmaj7 / B7 / Em

VERSE
Em        Em/D#         Em/D
Everybody wants to be a cat,

E/C#      Cmaj7     Am6/C
because a cat's the only cat

    C7               B7
who knows where it's at.

Em          Em/D#              Em/D   Em/C#
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat,

Cmaj7             Bm7     Em         Bm7 / Em
'cause everything else is obsolete.

CHORUS
Em    Am            Am/G#
Now a square with a horn,

Am/G         Am/F#
can make you wish you weren't born,

      G
ever'time he plays;

B7
and with a square in the act, he can set music back

       Em  Am  B7     / C / B7
to the caveman days.

VERSE
Em                    Em/D#              Em/D
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing,

Em/C# Cmaj7          Am6/C
but a cat's the only cat

    C7           B7
who knows how to swing.
    Em

Who wants to dig

a long-haired gig

or stuff like that?

When everybody wants to be a cat.


CHORUS
A square with that horn,

makes you wish you weren't born,

ever'time he plays;

and with a square in the act,

he's gonna set this music back

to the Stone Age days.


VERSE

Everybody wants to be a cat,

because a cat's the only cat

who knows where it's at;

while playin' jazz you always has a Welcome mat,

'cause everybody digs a swingin' cat.

Everybody digs a swingin' cat.
