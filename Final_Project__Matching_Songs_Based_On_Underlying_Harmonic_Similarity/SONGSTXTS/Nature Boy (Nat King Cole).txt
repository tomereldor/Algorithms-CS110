VERSE 1

E7    Am         Dm  E7              Am         Dm7
There was a boy, a very strange enchanted boy.
     E       E7      Am   Am+7 Am7  Am6
They say he wandered very far, very far,
Dm7   Am       E7
Over land and sea
  Dm7        E7   Bm7-5   Am        F        Dm7    E7
A little shy and sad of eye, but very wise was he.

VERSE 2
    Am           Dm         E7     Am        Dm7
And then one day, a magic day he passed my way;
     E        E7      Am   Am+7    Am7        Am6
And while we spoke of many things, fools and kings,
Dm7      Am     E7
This he said to me,
     Gdim     Dm7         Bm7-5      Am   Am+7
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
   Bm7-5    E7      Bm7-5      E7 E7+5   Am     E7
Is just to love and be loved in return."
