VERSE
    G9              G        G9
And now the purple dusk of twilight time,
B7                               E        E7
steals across the meadows of my heart;
Am             Cm        G            Em
High up in the sky, the little stars climb,
F#       F#7               D     D7
always reminding me, that we're apart.

VERSE
     G9              G            G9
You wander down the lane and far away,
B7                               E     E7
leaving me a song that will not die;
Am               Cm          G     Em
Love is now the stardust, of yesterday,
    D7            Am        G     Cm   G
The music of the years gone by.

B            CM7     C     Am
Sometimes I wonder why I spend,
     C      F       F7                 G
the lonely night, dreaming of a song;
    Em       Bm           E7
The melody, haunts my reverie,
    Am                   Am7    Am
and I am once again with you.

CHORUS
Am7       D       D7
When our love was new,
D         D7           G         D
and each kiss an inspiration;
     A            G     A7          G
But that was long ago, now my consolation,
D7         Am7      C   D7
is in the stardust of a song.

CODA:
 CM7      C     Am          C        F
Beside a garden wall, when stars are bright,
F7                  G
You are in my arms,
            E    Bm7             E7
the nightingale tells his fairy tale.
  Am7  E7         Em7   Am7      Am
A paradise where roses bloom,
         D     A7 D7
Though I dream in vain,
       G        Em    F#7     B7
in my heart it will remain,
C            E7      Am7
My stardust melody,
    D7           C    D7    G      Cm    G
the memory, of love s re   frain.
