INTRO
G C D  2x

VERSE 1
        C  D   G
I have often dreamed
       C   D   G
Of a far off place
         C   D   Em7
Where a hero's welcome
          C           D
Would be waiting for me
            C      D    G
Where the crowds will cheer
           C   D   Em
When they see my face
        C     B    Em
And a voice keeps saying
G         C                 D
This is where I'm meant to be


CHORUS 1
         G      Am
I'll be there someday
 G             D
I can go the distance
         G       Am
I will find my way
 G             D
If I can be strong
        G     C
I know ev'ry mile
         Em        Am
Will be worth my while
        C  D    G
When I go the distance
          C         D     G
I'll be right where I belong


INTERLUDE
G D C x2


VERSE 2
        C  D   G
Down an unknown road
        C  D   G
To embrace my fate
            C   D   Em7
Though the road may wander
         C          D
It will lead me to you
       C   D   G
And a thousand years
          C   D    Em
Would be worth the wait
        C   B  E
It may take a lifetime
G    C                   D
But somehow I'll see it through


CHORUS 2
       G          Am
And I won't look back
      G       D
I can go the distance
         G        Am
And I'll stay on track
      G              D
No I won't accept defeat
        G       C
It's an uphill slope
      Em     Am
But I won't lose hope
       C   D   G
Till I go the distance
        C      D       G
And my journey is complete


INTERLUDE
G D C x2


BRIDGE
        Bb               Eb          F       D
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
       G                   C               B
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart


CHORUS 3
        G         Am
Like a shooting star
G              D
I can go the distance
        G         Am
I will search the world
G               D
I will face its harms
   G              A
I don't care how far
B             Em
I can go the distance
        C    D  G
Till I find my hero's welcome
C        D        G
Waiting in your arms...


INTERLUDE
G D C x2


CLOSING CHORUS
        G         C
I will search the world
       Em        Am
I will face its harms
       C    D   G
Till I find my hero's welcome
C        D       C        D  G
Waiting in your arms...
