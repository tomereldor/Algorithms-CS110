VERSE:
D                   A
I can show you the world
D                      A
Shining, shimmering, splendid
F#m                         Bm
Tell me, princess, now when did
          G                D
You last let your heart decide?
D                A
I can open your eyes
D                  A
Take you wonder by wonder
F#m                 Bm
Over, sideways and under
      G            D
On a magic carpet ride

CHORUS:
              A    D
A whole new world
         A                Bb
A new fantastic point of view
           G      D
No one to tell us no
   G        D
Or where to go
   Bm                E
Or say we're only dreaming
              A    D
A whole new world
             A            Bb
A dazzling place I never knew
             G       D
But when I'm way up here
     G          D
It's crystal clear
     Bm                  A           D
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
D
Now I'm in a whole new world with you
